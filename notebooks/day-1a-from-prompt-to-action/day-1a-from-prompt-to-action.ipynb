      "helpful_assistant > The Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible and modular open-source framework designed for developing and deploying AI agents. It aims to make agent development more akin to traditional software development, simplifying the creation, deployment, and orchestration of agentic architectures, ranging from simple tasks to complex workflows. While optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem, the ADK is model-agnostic and deployment-agnostic, allowing compatibility with other frameworks.\n",
